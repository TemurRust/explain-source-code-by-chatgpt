# File: client-go/kubernetes/typed/policy/v1beta1/policy_client.go

The `client-go/kubernetes/typed/policy/v1beta1/policy_client.go` file in the `client-go` project under K8s organization is responsible for providing the client functionality for the Policy API group and the v1beta1 version. It contains various structs and functions that allow users to interact with the Kubernetes API for policy-related operations.

#### PolicyV1beta1Interface and PolicyV1beta1Client
The `PolicyV1beta1Interface` and `PolicyV1beta1Client` are two important struct types defined in the `policy_client.go` file.

- `PolicyV1beta1Interface` defines the interface for the Policy API group in the v1beta1 version. It includes methods for interacting with different resources like Evictions and PodDisruptionBudgets.

- `PolicyV1beta1Client` implements the `PolicyV1beta1Interface` and provides the actual implementation of the methods defined in the interface. It is used to communicate with the Kubernetes API server and perform operations related to policy resources.

#### Evictions, PodDisruptionBudgets, NewForConfig, NewForConfigAndClient, NewForConfigOrDie, New, setConfigDefaults, RESTClient
The `policy_client.go` file also includes various functions that are used for different purposes:

- `Evictions` is a function that returns an interface to work with the Evictions resource in the Policy API group.

- `PodDisruptionBudgets` is a function that returns an interface to work with the PodDisruptionBudgets resource in the Policy API group.

- `NewForConfig` is a function that creates a new client for the Policy API group using the provided configuration.

- `NewForConfigAndClient` is a function that creates a new client for the Policy API group using the provided configuration and client.

- `NewForConfigOrDie` is a function that creates a new client for the Policy API group using the provided configuration or panics if the configuration is invalid.

- `New` is a function that creates a new client for the Policy API group using the provided REST client.

- `setConfigDefaults` is a function that sets default values for the provided configuration.

- `RESTClient` is a function that returns the underlying REST client used by the Policy API client.

These functions provide different ways to initialize and interact with the client for the Policy API group in the `client-go` library. They allow users to perform actions like creating, updating, deleting, and listing policy-related resources in a Kubernetes cluster.
