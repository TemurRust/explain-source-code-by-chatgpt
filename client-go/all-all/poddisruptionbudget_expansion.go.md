# File: client-go/listers/policy/v1beta1/poddisruptionbudget_expansion.go

#### Purpose of the `poddisruptionbudget_expansion.go` file in the `client-go` project

The `poddisruptionbudget_expansion.go` file in the `client-go` project serves the purpose of expanding the functionality of the `PodDisruptionBudget` listers. It contains additional code that adds extra capabilities to the listers for the `policy/v1beta1` API group.

#### Role of the `PodDisruptionBudgetListerExpansion` and `PodDisruptionBudgetNamespaceListerExpansion` structures

The `PodDisruptionBudgetListerExpansion` and `PodDisruptionBudgetNamespaceListerExpansion` structures are used to extend and enhance the capabilities of the `PodDisruptionBudget` listers generated by the `client-go` library.

- `PodDisruptionBudgetListerExpansion`: This structure provides additional methods and functionality to the `PodDisruptionBudgetLister` interface. It allows for more advanced querying and manipulation of `PodDisruptionBudget` objects.

- `PodDisruptionBudgetNamespaceListerExpansion`: This structure extends the `PodDisruptionBudgetNamespaceLister` interface, which is used for listing `PodDisruptionBudget` objects within a specific namespace. It provides additional methods and functionality specific to namespace-scoped operations.

These structures are typically used when working with `PodDisruptionBudget` objects in Kubernetes applications, allowing developers to perform more complex operations and queries on these resources.

#### Purpose of the `GetPodPodDisruptionBudgets` functions

The `GetPodPodDisruptionBudgets` functions are utility functions provided by the `client-go` library for retrieving the `PodDisruptionBudget` objects associated with a given pod. There are likely multiple versions of this function in the `poddisruptionbudget_expansion.go` file, each corresponding to a different version of the `PodDisruptionBudget` API.

These functions accept a `kubernetes.Interface` object and a pod name as input parameters, and return a list of `PodDisruptionBudget` objects that are associated with the specified pod. They are useful for retrieving information about the disruption budget that applies to a particular pod, which can be important for managing the availability and reliability of applications running in a Kubernetes cluster.
