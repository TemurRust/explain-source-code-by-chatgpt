# File: traceback_c.c

traceback_c.c file is part of the Go programming language's runtime package. It is used to implement the traceback functionality in Go programs.

When a Go program encounters a runtime error, such as a null pointer dereference or an out-of-bounds array access, the program will panic. At this point, the traceback function is called to print information about the error, including the function call stack.

The traceback function in Go is implemented in C, using the traceback_c.c file. This file contains the C code that runs when a runtime error occurs, and is responsible for walking the call stack to generate the traceback information.

The traceback_c.c file uses a combination of assembly language and C code to walk the call stack. It first reads the program counter (PC) and stack pointer (SP) register values from the processor, and then it uses this information to traverse the stack, inspecting each frame and extracting the relevant information such as function names and line numbers.

Once the traceback_c.c file has collected all the relevant information, it formats it into a human-readable format and prints it to the standard output.

Overall, the traceback_c.c file is an essential part of the Go programming language's runtime package, allowing developers to quickly identify and debug runtime errors in their programs.
